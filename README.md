# CS Home Work
These are all my home works for CS.

# About me
I'm an Italian student studying CS in high school.

# Why did I create this repo?
Simply to share my works with anyone who could need it, so don't be afraid and copy-paste it in your project (though I'd very like to be mentioned in those project, but it's not necessary)

P.S.: Everything is located in Italian, prints and comments alike, so, if you want to contribute, what about localize everything in English?
